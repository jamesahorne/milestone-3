# Subify Sandwich Filling Site
This project is for Milestone 3 of Code Institutes Full Stack Development Diploma, and uses Python, Flask and MongoDB in the backend and HTML, CSS, Materialize and JavaScript in the frontend.
Subify is a sandwich fillings recipe site, giving users the ability to read recipes and filter which recipes they see, share their recipe ideas, add ingredients and allergens to the database and edit and delete recipes. There is also a data page displaying different pieces of information about the recipes, including data on what the main ingredients and allergens used in recipes are, how many recipes are vegetarian or contain meat and the different cooking times recipes need.

## UX
### User Stories
* As a user wanting to add a recipe, on the home page I click on the Share Ideas button, which takes me to the Add Recipe page where there is a form which adds a new recipe to the database.
* As a user wanting to add an ingredient, when on the Add Recipe page I click on the Add ingredient button (next to the Ingredients dropdown), which takes me to the Add Ingredient page where there is a form which adds a new ingredient to the database.
* As a user wanting to add an allergen, when on the Add Recipe page I click on the Add allergen button (next to the Allergen dropdown), which takes me to the Add Allergen page where there is a form which adds a new allergen to the database.
* As a user wanting to edit a recipe, on the full recipe page of a recipe I click on the Edit button, which takes me to the Edit Recipe page where there is a form which replaces the current version of the recipe with the edited version to the database.
* As a user wanting to delete a recipe, on the full recipe page of a recipe I click on the Delete button, which deletes the recipe from the database.
* As a user wanting to view recipes, on the home page I click on the Need Ideas button, which takes me to the Recipes page where I can view all the recipes in the database.
* As a user wanting to filter recipes, on the Recipes page I click on the Filter recipes button, which reveals a hidden form with categories that you can use to filter (e.g. if the recipe is vegetarian).


## Testing
### Manual Testing
To test that Flask has installed and is working properly, I created a test function with a route in it that will display the text "Hello World." It worked on the browser.



Add quanitities through another dropdown per ingredient? - For next version
