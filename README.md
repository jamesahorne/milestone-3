# Subify Sandwich Filling Site
This project is for Milestone 3 of Code Institutes Full Stack Development Diploma, and uses Python, Flask and MongoDB in the backend and HTML, CSS, Materialize and JavaScript in the frontend.
Subify is a sandwich fillings recipe site, giving users the ability to read recipes and filter which recipes they see, share their recipe ideas, add ingredients and allergens to the database and edit and delete recipes. There is also a data page displaying different pieces of information about the recipes, including data on what the main ingredients and allergens used in recipes are, how many recipes are vegetarian or contain meat and the different cooking times recipes need.



## Testing

### Manual Testing
To test that Flask has installed and is working properly, I created a test function with a route in it that will display the text "Hello World." It worked on the browser.



Add quanitities through another dropdown per ingredient? - For next version
